## 1. Problem Statement

Mysuru attracts over **3 million visitors annually**, yet tourism is heavily
concentrated around just 3–4 mainstream spots — Mysuru Palace, Chamundi Hills,
and Brindavan Gardens. During peak seasons like Dasara, these sites face
severe overcrowding while local artisans (sandalwood carvers, silk weavers,
inlay craftsmen) and hidden cultural gems remain **virtually invisible and
economically underserved**.

> 35% of domestic tourists actively seek authentic cultural experiences
> but cannot find them. — Ministry of Tourism Report

## 2. Our Solution

**Namma Mysuru** is a role-based web application that connects three types of users:

| Role | What They Get |
|------|--------------|
| 🧳 **Tourist** | Discover verified hidden gems with GPS maps, reviews & wishlist |
| 🛍️ **Customer** | Shop authentic Mysuru crafts directly from artisans |
| 🎨 **Local Artisan** | Get a digital profile, list products & reach customers |
